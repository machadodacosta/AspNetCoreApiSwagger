At this example we have the Swashbuckle and ASP.NET Core

- Swagger: API design is prone to errors, and itâ€™s extremely difficult and time-consuming to spot and rectify mistakes when modeling APIs. Swagger Editor was the first editor built for designing APIs with the OpenAPI Specification (OAS), and has continued to  meet the needs of developers building APIs with OAS. The Editor validates your design in real-time, checks for OAS compliancy, and provides visual feedback on the go.
- Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.Swagger: a Swagger object model and middleware to expose SwaggerDocument objects as JSON endpoints.
- Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.SwaggerGen: a Swagger generator that builds SwaggerDocument objects directly from your routes, controllers, and models. It's typically combined with the Swagger endpoint middleware to automatically expose Swagger JSON.
- Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.SwaggerUI: an embedded version of the Swagger UI tool. It interprets Swagger JSON to build a rich, customizable experience for describing the web API functionality. It includes built-in test harnesses for the public methods.
